Requirements
Based on the code that you wrote in the previous assignment (where you collected numeric inputs from the Scanner), you now need to turn that code into a new method.

This new method should return an Integer.

However, this method should return null if the number that the user inputs is outside of the expected range of 50 to 300, otherwise it should just return the value that the user input into the scanner.

You then need to take the value that was returned from this method, and display it inside of a console message that says "The number you typed in was: [theReturnedValueFromMethodHere]"

Do NOT put the final console message display code inside of the new method. The final console message display code should be inside of your main method.

Example Output #1
Type a number between 50 and 300
75
The number you typed in was: 75

Example Output #2
Type a number between 50 and 300
49
The number you typed in was: null
